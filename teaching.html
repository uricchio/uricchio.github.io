    <p>
     As an IRACDA postdoc, I get to spend a substantial portion of my effort training in evidence-based teaching and instructing at SJSU.  
     In my capacity as an instructor, I strive to apply scientific teaching principles in the context of a student-centered learning environment.

   <h3 style ="margin-left: 1%">Postdoc pedagogy minisymposia</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 2%">
    <p>
     Postdocs tend to spend the vast majority of their time performing research, and probably rightly so.  But if and when we are successful in making the transition to 
     academic faculty, a substantial portion of our job responsibilities will be to teach and train the next generation of scientists.  To help address this gap in postdoc training,
     my collaborator <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hFI1MsMAAAAJ&hl=en">Whitney Heavner</a> and I designed and implemented a series of teaching minisymposia for 
     Stanford postdocs. We obtained <a href="http://med.stanford.edu/academy/programs/grants/2016-2017-innovation-grants-recipients.html">competitive funding from the
     Stanford Teaching and Mentoring Academy</a> to recruit 4 experts in pedagogical techniques to Stanford's campus to train postdocs.  We focused on four core areas of evidence-based 
     STEM teaching, including active learning, diversity in the classroom, quantitative reasoning, and methods of assessment. Whitney created a nice webpage about our series of events, 
     which you can find <a href="http://stanford.edu/~heavner/teaching/">here</a>.

    In fall 2017 I co-instructed an undergraduate ecology course (Biology 160 with Scott Shaffer at SJSU.  You can find the syllabus <a href="bio160.pdf">here</a>.  Thanks to Scott for 
    acting as my teaching mentor, and thanks to my awesome SJSU students for their attention and feedback!

    <p>
    I am currently co-instructing Evolutionary Genetics (Biology 118) with Leslee Parr at SJSU.  Dr. Parr is an expert in the application of active learning techniques, and I am learning
    a lot of new approaches by co-teaching with her.  Thanks Leslee!

    You can find a couple examples of in-class activities that I've desgined for this course <a href="man_flu.pdf">here</a> and <a href="molec_clock.pdf">here</a>.

   <h3 style ="margin-left: 1%">Stanford biocore explorations for undergraduates</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 2%">
    <p>
    I designed and taught a <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/bio41/Webpages/explorations.html">biocore exploration</a> along with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QZHV8SkAAAAJ&hl=en">Alison Feder</a> at Stanford in Fall 2015.
    Biocore explorations are an opportunity for postdoctoral and graduate student researchers to interact with undergraduates enrolled in the core biology course.
    Instructors typically design an interactive workshop based on their research area.  Alison and I designed a course that combined some quantitative reasoning with 
    an exploration of human genetic data.  Our central question was "is there evidence in human genetic data that human traits are under selection?" 
    <br>
    <br>
    We modeled our workshop on a recent study that used genetic data to provide evidence that natural selection has <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v44/n9/abs/ng.2368.html">shaped human height</a>. 
    The students used computer code that we designed to explore the impact of selection on quantitative traits by changing model paremeters, and then used real human genomic data to test 
    their intuition. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Our goal in this course was to develop a computationally-minded set of activities that the students could interact with, in the spirit of active-learning, which I think we (mostly!) 
    achieved.  In future versions of this course, I would love to spend more time developing computational skills so the students can write their own code, and replicate the
    analyses in multiple academic papers.  You can find the slides from the lecture portion of our class <a href="biocore.pdf">here</a>.

   <h3 style ="margin-left: 1%">Stanford Postdoc Pedagogy Journal Club</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 2%">
    <p>
     Stanford has a monthly meeting for postdocs interested in pedagogy to discuss papers on important evidence-based teaching topics.  I am a frequent attendee, and
     have twice led the discussion. You can find out more about the meetings I led <a href="http://postdocs.stanford.edu/education/pedagogyjournalclub.html#apr">here</a>
     and <a href="http://postdocs.stanford.edu/education/pedagogyjournalclub.html#jul2">here</a>.

   <h3 style ="margin-left: 1%">Stanford CEHG high school outreach</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 2%">
    <p>
     The Center for Computational, Evolutionary, and Human Genomics recently started a series of outreach events.  Our goal is to inspire high school students of diverse 
     backgrounds to consider pursuing careers in science, and especially genetics.  In 2015, I helped to implement the inaugural event, in which we invited 
     students from Sequoia High School to visit Stanford labs and speak with a broad range of graduate students and postdocs.  One of my main contributions was organizing and
     designing a pamphlet for high schoolers about studying science in college, which you can find <a href="https://cehg.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/avid_pack_3.pdf">here</a>.

    <p>
     I lectured in Stanford's undergraduate <i>Evolution</i> class in 2016 and 2017 about the evolution of deleterious genetic variation in humans. You can find my most recent slides 
     <a href="Human_traits_allele_load.pdf">here</a>.

    <h3 style ="margin-left: 1%">Graduate student teaching in computational biology</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 2%">
    <p>
    I was a graduate student instructor for BIOE 131/231 (an undergraduate and graduate student course in computational biology at UC Berkeley) in 2013 and a graduate teaching assistant for
    <a href="https://coursecatalog.ucsf.edu/course/1872">computational evolutionary genomics</a> (a graduate course at UCSF) in 2014.  I had the chance to lead instructional material in the form of lectures, question and answer, and computational     labs. I was fotunate to be awarded the UCSF teaching assistant excellence award for my work in computational evolutionary genomics.
