     <p> Many species worldwide are experiencing rapid, human-induced changes in their environment that threaten their 
        persistence, but we still struggle to predict which species will adapt to these changing circumstances, and 
        how adaptation may affect species composition in nature. 
        We develop ecological models, evolutionary models, and statistical inference 
        techniques to detect selection signals in genomic and phenotypic data. Long-term goals of our work are to
        use these models to predict when species maintain sufficient genetic variation to adapt to rapid environmental change,
        and to understand how evolutionary processes affect our ability to detect the genetic variation underlying heritable
        traits.

   Evolutionary biologists have catalogued many adaptation events and studied their genomic basis across species, such as the convergent evolution of toxicity or rapid 
   evolution of pesticide resistance. 
   Most of these inferences of adaptation
   proceed backwards in time -- evolutionary biologists use genomic, phenptypic, and ecological data to understand how past environments led to the variation that we observe today.
   How can we repurpose these backwards-looking methods to understand when adaptation is likely to occur? Is adaptation always inherently unpredictable, or 
   are there certain traits and environmental changes that result in predictable outcomes in terms of population dynamics or adaptation events? 
   We see this as both a pressing application of ecological and 
   evolutionary theory within the context of <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/69630">global change</a> and a fundamental theoretical question about the rate, mode, and  mechansism of 
   <a href="https://uricchio.github.io/papers/uricchio2019NatEcoEvo.pdf">adaptive evolution</a>. We are studying questions related to the genomic and evolutionary 
    response to environmental change
     in a number of systems, including marine molluscs, frogs, pigeons, <a href ="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/evo.14594">moths</a>, and plants such as <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.11.491512v1">alpine carnations</a>.

   PhD students SJ McGeady and Alejandro Calderon are both working in this area. SJ is investigating how infectious disease spillover
   affects both population dynamics and adaptation rates, specifically in conserved disease-interacting genes. 
   Alejandro is developing simulation methods to study how changes
   in voltinism (the number of generations per year) for insect populations could affect the rate of differentiation in their genomes in collaboration
   with <a href="https://ase.tufts.edu/biology/labs/dopman/">Erik Dopman's lab.</a>

Exotic species can dramatically affect species composition by directly out-competing native species, but in some cases native and introduced species may coexist stably.
<a href="https://uricchio.github.io/papers/Uricchio2019AmNat.pdf">We studied competition between native and exotic species in California grasslands</a>. Our analysis suggests
that exotic annual species are liekly to outcompete California native species, but that their likelihood of persistence depends integrally on the order of arrival of their exotic competitors.
Our results provide a contrast to some earlier studies that focused on undisturbed communities and found stabilizing niche differences between species, perhaps due to the long co-evolutionary history of naturally co-occurring species. Studies like this one can help inform our thinking about the processes that 
could explain diversity in nature, but we still know so little about how biotic interactions affect species' distributions and persistence! 
<br>
<br>
Our ongoing work seeks to incorporate genomic data into ecological models to predict when species composition is likely to depend on rapid evolutionary 
processes. Evolutionary dynamics could be an imporant component of assembly processes in nature, and could be particularly relevant for species that 
experience shifts in their environental context due to climate change or introduction to new habitats. Microbes are an ideal model for asking such questions
because of their short generation times, feasibility of whole-genome sequencing, well-characterized biological interactions, and natural hitory relevance. 
Graduate student Kasturic Lele is using a combination of experimental microbial community assembly data, genomic sequecnes, and model-based simulations 
to characterize how evolutionary and ecological processes may affect community stability in the sourdough microbiome. She is working in collaboration with
<a href="https://sites.tufts.edu/wolfelab/">Dr. Ben Wolfe's lab at Tufts.</a>

    Many traits have a genetic component. In humans, examples include eye color, height, and body mass index, and also many common diseases, such as asthma and cardiovascular disease.
    Evolutionarily, this poses a question: if some diseases have a genetic component, how can they be common? Put another way, why hasn't natural selection constrained disease-causing
    genetic variation to be very rare, thereby making diseases very rare?  
   
    Some hypotheses include:
    </p>
    <ul "margin-left: 5%">

      <li class="p">Natural selection did not act on disease variation for common human diseases in ancestral human populations (perhaps because these diseases are primarily a result of modern 
                    enviornments).</li>
      <li class="p">Disease genotypes are detrimental in the context of the disease, but advantageous for another reason (e.g., a disease
          variant increased the rate of surviving childhood in ancestral human populations, but shortens the expected
          lifespan in adulthood).
      <li  class="p">Disease variation is under very strong negative selection and most disease variation is very rare, but there are so many sites in the 3 billion
          base pairs of the human genome that confer disease risk that disease is still common (i.e., there are many different ways to get same the same disease with different rare
          genetic variants).</li>
      <li  class="p">Heritable human diseases are not as heritable as we think they are (i.e., genetics plays a smaller role than environment).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    To date, it's been very difficult to tease apart these possible explanations and make sense of how selection does (or does
    not) act on common, heritable human diseases.

    Our work has mostly focused on the first three possibilities.  We
    use population genetic models of natural selection and complex phenotypes to model recent (~100,000 yrs)
    human evolutionary history, and to infer how <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/evl3.97">natural selection shapes genetic variation</a>.
    During my PhD, we showed that
    state-of-the-art techniques for detecting risk loci in the genome
    <a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/7/863">are not as effective as one would hope</a>
    when selection acts directly on trait-related variation.  We also showed that selection on RNA expression is likely
    to <a href="https://uricchio.github.io/papers/Hernandez2019.pdf">dramatically increase the relative importance of rare variation in driving gene expression</a>, suggesting that
    evolutionary constraint has slowed the rate of evolution of genetic elements underlying gene expression.
