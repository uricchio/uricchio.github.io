    <p> Many species worldwide are experiencing rapid, human-induced changes in their environment that threaten their 
        persistence, but we still struggle to predict which species will adapt to these changing circumstances, and 
        how adaptation may affect species composition in nature.  I develop evolutionary models and statistical inference 
        techniques to detect signals adaptation in genomic and phenotypic data.  A long-term goal of my work is to
        use these models to predict when species maintain sufficient genetic variation to adapt to rapid environmental change.

   David Enard </a> and I are developing new methods to infer adaptation rate and strength from genomic data in more realistic evolutionary scenarios.
   <a href="https://rdcu.be/bAxPc">Our work</a> 
   argues that weakly beneficial alleles are likely to be a major contributor to the adaptation process, and that viruses have driven
   a preponderance of strongly fitness-increasing adaptation in recent mammalian evolution.  This work relies heavily on our ability 
   to perform <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4012482/">computationally efficient simulations of linked 
   selection</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25417809">complex demography</a>.

Exotic species can dramatically affect species composition  by directly out-competing native species, but in some cases native and introduced species may coexist stably.
<a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/701434">We studied competition between native and exotic species in California grasslands</a>. Our analysis suggests
that invaders dominate over California native species, but that the likelihood of persistence of natives depends integrally on the order of arrival of their exotic competitors.
Our results provide a contrast to many earlier studies that focused on undisturbed communities and found stabilizing niche differences between specices.  My ongoing work seeks to incorporate genomic data into ecoligical models to predict when species ccomposition is likely to depend on rapid evolutionary processes.

    Many traits have a genetic component.  In humans, examples include eye color, height, and body mass index, and also many common diseases, such as asthma and cardiovascular disease.  
    Evolutionarily, this poses a question: if some diseases have a genetic component, how can they be common?  Put another way, why hasn't natural selection constrained disease-causing
    genetic variation to be very rare, thereby making diseases very rare?  The short answer is: although we have many promising leads, we're still working on figuring it out.  Some
    hypotheses include:
    </p>
    <ul "margin-left: 5%">
         
      <li class="p">Natural selection did not act on disease variation for common human diseases in ancestral human populations.</li>
      <li class="p">Disease genotypes are detrimental in the context of the disease, but advantageous for another reason (e.g., a disease 
          variant increased the rate of surviving childhood in ancestral human populations, but shortens the expected
          lifespan in adulthood).
      <li  class="p">Disease variation is under very strong negative selection and most disease variation is very rare, but there are so many sites in the 3 billion 
          base pairs of the human genome that confer disease risk that disease is still common (i.e., there are many different ways to get same the same disease with different rare
          geneteic variants).</li>
      <li  class="p">Heritable human diseases are not as heritable as we think they are (i.e., genetics plays a smaller role than environment).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    To date, it's been very difficult to tease apart these possible explanations and make sense of how selection does (or does 
    not) act on common, heritable human diseases.  My work has mostly focused on the first three possibilities.  I
    use population genetic models of natural selection and complex phenotypes to model recent (~100,000 yrs) 
    human evolutionary history, and to infer how <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/evl3.97">natural selection shapes genetic varition</a>.  
    Together with my PhD advisor Ryan Hernandez, I showed that 
    state-of-the-art techniques for detecting risk loci in the genome 
    <a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/7/863">are not as effective as one would hope</a>
    when selection acts directly on trait-related variation.  We also showed that selection on RNA expression is likely 
    to <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/15/219238">dramatically increase the relative importance of rare variation in driving gene expression</a>, suggesting that
    evolutionary constraint has controlled the rate of evolution of genetic elements underlying gene experession.
